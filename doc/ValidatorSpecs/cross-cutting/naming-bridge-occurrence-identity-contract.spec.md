# Naming Bridge Occurrence Identity Contract

- **Classification:** Normative for the Naming occurrence bridge identity, field-eligibility, existing v1 context/compatibility, enrichment, versioning, and migration contract; descriptive only where explicitly labeled as **current runtime truth**.
- **Applies to:** Cross-slice occurrence identity used by Addressing, Naming bridge observations, Tree evidence joins, and suite-core neutral transport.
- **Status:** Contract/specification decision slice only for issue #651; no runtime behavior is changed by this artifact.
- **Issue context:** Refs #651 and Refs #647. Earlier identity baseline: Refs #621, Refs #618, and Slice 1 audit #648 / PR #649.
- **Repo-reality input:** `doc/Audits/occurrence-identity-and-naming-tree-bridge.audit.md` and `doc/Audits/addressing-backed-naming-tree-bridge-enrichment-surfaces.audit.md`.

## 1. Purpose and authority boundary

This spec defines the neutral occurrence identity contract, the versioned Naming bridge envelope, and the normative decision gate for future enriched Naming occurrence bridge fields.

This artifact is intentionally narrow. It defines contract names, ownership boundaries, approved future field shapes, deferred/rejected candidate status, migration expectations, and non-goals only. It does not implement Naming bridge enrichment, does not change Tree joins or consumption policy, does not add runtime payload fields, does not wire Tree to a different provider, does not extract shared join helpers, and does not change CLI or report envelope behavior.

Authority posture:

1. Current source files, tests, and the issue #648 audit remain the source for **current runtime truth**.
2. This spec defines the **target contract direction** for future implementation slices.
3. A field marked `approved for a future enriched bridge version` is approved for an additive future contract shape only; it is **not current runtime truth** until a later implementation slice emits and tests it.
4. A field marked `deferred` is **deferred implementation work** that needs the named prerequisite before runtime payload use.
5. A field marked `rejected for bridge payload use` must not be emitted by the Naming bridge payload as a contract field.

## 2. Current runtime truth

Current runtime truth from the issue #648 / PR #649 audit:

- Naming bridge observations can be emitted in a versioned occurrence bridge payload with `bridgeContractVersion: naming-occurrence-bridge.v1`.
- The only resolved durable occurrence identity tuple for addressed Naming occurrence observations is `addressProfileId + addressedSnapshotId + occurrenceAddress`.
- Naming occurrence bridge observations currently preserve path/source trace fields: `repoRelativePath`, `path`, and optional `addressPath`.
- `path` and `repoRelativePath` remain compatibility/source-trace fields, not the preferred durable join identity.
- `addressPath` remains a compatibility/debug mirror unless it is explicitly equal to `occurrenceAddress`; it must not become a second competing occurrence identity.
- Current Naming bridge semantic evidence includes existing Naming-owned semantic fields such as `semanticName`, `familyRoot`, `semanticFamily`, optional `familySubgroup`, optional sorted `ambiguityFlags`, and optional sorted `splitFamilyFlags`.
- `occurrenceType` is existing optional v1 neutral occurrence-context / compatibility evidence when the addressed occurrence record supplies it. It remains Addressing-owned occurrence-type data; Naming may echo it, and valid v1 observations containing it remain valid.
- The bridge does not currently emit new enriched context partition fields such as `parentAddressPath`, `depth`, `orderIndex`, `lineageKey`, `contextPartitionKey`, `siblingContextKey`, `subtreeContextKey`, `semanticTokens`, `role`, `role-like fields`, `disambiguationNotes`, `evidenceStrength`, or `evidenceLimitNotes` merely because they may be useful.
- Tree staged intake and address-keyed join preparation may inspect the v1 bridge, but current Tree contributor behavior preserves fallback to path-keyed semantic-family evidence unless address-keyed evidence is clean and usable under Tree-owned policy.

## 3. Canonical occurrence identity contract

### 3.1 Namespace rule

`occurrenceAddress` is interpreted only inside the namespace identified by `addressProfileId` and `addressedSnapshotId`.

The tuple `addressProfileId + addressedSnapshotId + occurrenceAddress` is the preferred durable join identity for one addressed snapshot namespace. It is not a timeless global id, not a repo-wide immutable id across every profile, and not a semantic identity by itself.

### 3.2 Required durable identity tuple

For an addressed Naming occurrence observation, all three fields are required either directly on the observation or by an explicitly validated envelope inheritance rule:

| Field | Requirement | Owner | Contract meaning | Current runtime relationship |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `addressProfileId` | Required | Addressing | Identifier for the address profile whose grammar/provider semantics make `occurrenceAddress` meaningful. | Structural-addressing currently uses `profileId`; Naming bridge payloads normalize the contract field as `addressProfileId`. |
| `addressedSnapshotId` | Required | Addressing | Identifier for the specific addressed snapshot namespace shared by the producer and consumers during a run or staged payload exchange. | Structural-addressing has `snapshotOutputId`; whether that is sufficient as the durable snapshot namespace remains a later provider decision. |
| `occurrenceAddress` | Required | Addressing | Neutral occurrence address used for cross-slice joins inside the profile/snapshot namespace. | Current bridge payload construction can normalize an addressed occurrence `occurrenceAddress`, `address`, or `addressPath` into this field. |

Normative identity rules:

- The tuple remains the preferred durable join identity for addressed Naming occurrence observations.
- `path` and `repoRelativePath` remain compatibility/source-trace fields.
- `addressPath` remains a compatibility/debug mirror unless explicitly equal to `occurrenceAddress`.
- No enrichment field may replace, weaken, override, or compete with the canonical observation identity tuple: `addressProfileId + addressedSnapshotId + occurrenceAddress`.
- Consumers must not treat observation array index, path, semantic family, context partition key, diagnostic metadata, parent-reference evidence, or Tree placement evidence as a replacement identity. Parent-reference evidence is permitted only as optional containment evidence, never as the observation's own primary identity.

Explicit identity distinction:

- Canonical observation identity: `addressProfileId + addressedSnapshotId + occurrenceAddress`. This required tuple identifies the observed occurrence.
- Optional parent-reference identity evidence: `parentOccurrenceAddress`. This optional future enrichment field is neutral Addressing-owned containment evidence about the observed occurrence's parent.
- `parentOccurrenceAddress` does not replace the observation's own `occurrenceAddress`, must remain inside the same validated `addressProfileId` and `addressedSnapshotId` namespace, and must not become a second primary identity for the observation. Tree may later consume it only as neutral evidence after Tree validates the canonical observation tuple and applies Tree-owned join policy.

## 4. Versioned Naming bridge envelope contract

### 4.1 Current valid version

`naming-occurrence-bridge.v1` remains valid. Existing v1 producers and consumers must continue to preserve the canonical identity tuple and path-keyed compatibility/source-trace fields during migration.

### 4.2 Future enriched version decision

`occurrenceType` does not require a bridge version bump because it is existing optional v1 neutral occurrence-context / compatibility evidence when supplied by the addressed occurrence record. Valid v1 observations containing optional `occurrenceType` must not be stripped, rejected, or treated as unsupported enrichment.

New approved enrichment fields in this spec require a future explicit version named `naming-occurrence-bridge.v2` unless a later contract slice intentionally chooses a separately named additive sidecar. The default path is an additive v2 bridge payload, not mutation of v1 semantics.

The v2 bridge may keep the same top-level envelope fields as v1 and add an explicitly versioned observation enrichment block or direct observation fields for genuinely new approved fields that valid v1 observations do not already emit. A later implementation slice must choose the concrete serialization route before runtime emission. Until that slice lands, new approved fields below are contract-approved but **not current runtime truth**.

Future v2 enrichment is additive to the current Naming semantic observation payload. Any future `naming-occurrence-bridge.v2` payload, or any additive sidecar strategy, must preserve the existing Naming-owned semantic observation fields and semantics, including at minimum `semanticName`, `familyRoot`, `semanticFamily`, `familySubgroup` when present, `ambiguityFlags` when present, `splitFamilyFlags` when present, existing Naming disambiguation evidence when present, existing path/source-trace compatibility fields, and optional existing v1 `occurrenceType` behavior when available. Future enrichment adds neutral occurrence context, approved Naming metadata, or versioned diagnostics around that semantic evidence; it must not replace, flatten, omit, or downgrade the current semantic interpretation.

A sidecar approach must either preserve direct linkage to the complete current semantic observation payload or define an explicit deterministic association that leaves the existing semantic payload intact. Tree must still receive Naming semantic evidence plus any approved enrichment; Tree must not be forced to reconstruct semantic-family interpretation from raw names, paths, or enrichment fields.

### 4.3 Version handling and unknown fields

Version handling rules:

- v1 consumers must continue accepting optional `occurrenceType` as existing v1 context/compatibility evidence when present; it is not unknown enrichment and not unsupported enrichment.
- v1 consumers may ignore unknown enrichment fields only if those fields are not needed to validate identity and do not change v1 semantics.
- Consumers that interpret v2 enrichment need an explicit v2-aware intake path or an explicitly documented sidecar intake path.
- Unsupported bridge versions must be handled as unsupported future evidence, not as invalid identity by default.
- Diagnostics must distinguish invalid identity from unsupported enrichment:
  - **invalid identity:** missing, non-string, empty, mismatched, duplicate, or namespace-incompatible `addressProfileId`, `addressedSnapshotId`, or `occurrenceAddress`.
  - **unsupported enrichment:** recognized identity with a bridge version, field, or sidecar that the consumer does not interpret.
  - **unsupported version:** a bridge contract version outside the consumer's supported set.
- Unsupported enrichment must not force fallback removal, shared-helper extraction, provider swaps, or Tree policy changes.

## 5. Ownership boundaries

| Surface | Addressing | Naming | Tree | Suite-core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Occurrence identity | Owns `occurrenceAddress`, address profile semantics, address grammar, addressed snapshot/provider output rules, and parent/child/sibling identity facts. | References identity to attach observations; does not define address grammar. | Consumes identity for tuple matching and join preparation; does not define Naming semantics. | Transports identity neutrally; does not own semantics. |
| Neutral occurrence context | Owns neutral lineage/depth/containment facts, parent/child/sibling identity facts, and deterministic occurrence ordering. | May copy approved neutral context as evidence when sourced from Addressing and shaped by this spec. | May consume neutral context only as evidence under Tree-owned qualification policy. | May stage opaque payloads without semantic ownership. |
| Semantic interpretation | Does not own Naming semantics. | Owns semantic-name, family-root, semantic-family, family-subgroup, token interpretation, role interpretation, ambiguity flags, split-family flags, disambiguation interpretation, bridge observation production, preservation of current semantic observation payloads, and approved semantic-evidence partitioning representation. | Consumes Naming semantic evidence plus approved enrichment for Tree-owned structural interpretation after joining; does not reconstruct Naming semantic-family interpretation from raw names, paths, or enrichment fields. | May report metadata without semantic ownership. |
| Tree conclusions | Does not own Tree placement conclusions. | Must not emit Tree conclusions. | Owns folder-kind interpretation, structural-home interpretation, semantic-home interpretation, placement reasoning, scatter/cluster reasoning, confidence, severity, findings, fallback selection, join diagnostics, and clean/usable evidence assessment. | May transport/report metadata without owning Tree conclusions. |

Suite-core owns only runner orchestration, staging, target/scope transport, source metadata, report-envelope mechanics, and neutral opaque payload transport.

## 6. Field eligibility table for existing v1 fields and future enriched bridge versions

### 6.1 Existing optional v1 context/compatibility field

| Field | Classification | Owner | Source of truth | Value shape | Required / optional | Null / absence behavior | Normalization and deterministic-order requirements | Identity status | Tree-consumption limitation | Versioning rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `occurrenceType` | existing optional v1 neutral occurrence-context / compatibility evidence | Addressing | Addressed occurrence record occurrence-type data supplied in current v1 observation production | non-empty string from the Addressing-owned vocabulary when supplied | Optional in v1 because existing production includes it only when available | Omit when unavailable; do not invent `unknown`; invalid values affect only this optional context field unless they break identity validation elsewhere | Preserve source spelling from the approved Addressing vocabulary; no mapping to Tree `folderKind`; no sorting role | Not part of the canonical durable observation identity tuple `addressProfileId + addressedSnapshotId + occurrenceAddress` | Tree may consume only as occurrence kind evidence; it is not Tree folderKind, structural-home policy, semantic-home policy, placement policy, confidence, severity, diagnostics, or findings | Retaining or documenting `occurrenceType` does not require `naming-occurrence-bridge.v2`; valid v1 observations containing it remain valid and must not be stripped, rejected, or treated as unsupported enrichment |

### 6.2 Candidate table for genuinely new future enrichment fields

Decision standard: approve only fields with a clear current source, a narrow semantic purpose, a deterministic representation, and a concrete need for the first enriched Naming bridge version. Defer fields that require a new vocabulary, an opaque grouping strategy, a separate role/token model, unclear source authority, or likely Tree-policy leakage. Reject fields that would encode Tree placement, folder/home interpretation, severity, confidence policy, or findings.

| Candidate | Decision status | Owner | Source of truth | Exact field name when approved | Value shape when approved | Required / optional when approved | Null / absence behavior when approved | Normalization and deterministic-order requirements when approved | Classification | Tree-consumption limitation | Explicit prerequisite when deferred | Reason when rejected |

| `orderIndex` | approved for a future enriched bridge version | Addressing | Addressed occurrence record deterministic traversal output | `occurrenceOrderIndex` | non-negative integer stable for the addressed snapshot traversal | Optional | Omit when unavailable; do not use `null`; invalid negative/non-integer values invalidate only the enrichment field, not the identity tuple | Numeric integer; represents Addressing traversal order only; consumers must not treat it as identity | neutral context / diagnostic metadata | Tree may use only for deterministic ordering or evidence review, not placement quality, severity, or confidence | n/a | n/a |
| `lineageKey` | deferred | Addressing, with Naming allowed to reference only after source is defined | No approved current source for bridge payload use | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | neutral context candidate | Tree must not consume a Naming-computed lineage key as structural-home or semantic-home evidence | Addressing must define an opaque, deterministic lineage/grouping key source and collision semantics, or the bridge must choose `parentOccurrenceAddress` instead | n/a |

Existing optional v1 context/compatibility set: `occurrenceType`.

Approved first enriched bridge set: `parentOccurrenceAddress`, `occurrenceDepth`, `occurrenceOrderIndex`, `disambiguationNotes`, and `evidenceLimitNotes`.

Deferred set: `lineageKey`, `contextPartitionKey`, `siblingContextKey`, `subtreeContextKey`, `semanticTokens`, `role`, and `role-like fields`.

Rejected set: `evidenceStrength`.

## 7. Guardrails for approved future enrichment fields

Every approved future enrichment field is governed by these rules:

1. Naming remains folder-agnostic.
2. The field is evidence, not Tree policy.
3. No enrichment field may replace, weaken, override, or compete with the canonical observation identity tuple: `addressProfileId + addressedSnapshotId + occurrenceAddress`.
4. `parentOccurrenceAddress`, when present, is optional neutral Addressing-owned parent-reference / containment identity evidence; it does not replace the observation's own `occurrenceAddress`, must remain inside the same validated `addressProfileId` and `addressedSnapshotId` namespace, and must not become a second primary identity for the observation.
5. The field must not encode folder kind, structural home, semantic home, placement judgment, scatter/cluster judgment, confidence, severity, Tree-owned diagnostics, or findings. Naming-owned diagnostic metadata fields may carry deterministic source/disambiguation notes only when approved in the field table and must not carry Tree verdicts.
6. Tree may consume the field only as evidence and retains all clean/usable evidence assessment, fallback selection, join diagnostics, placement reasoning, confidence, severity, Tree-owned diagnostics, and findings policy.
7. Tree may later consume `parentOccurrenceAddress` only as neutral evidence after Tree validates the canonical observation tuple and applies Tree-owned join policy.
8. The field does not move tuple matching or join preparation into Addressing.
9. The field does not require shared join-helper extraction.
10. The field must remain additive and versioned.
11. The field must preserve current path-keyed compatibility during migration.
12. A future implementation must not remove `path`, `repoRelativePath`, or path-keyed compatibility fallback solely because approved enrichment fields exist.
13. A future implementation must validate enriched fields separately from the required identity tuple so unsupported enrichment can be reported without mislabeling valid identity as invalid.

## 8. Fallback and migration rule

Future implementation slices must follow this migration rule:

1. Tree should prefer address-keyed joins when `addressProfileId`, `addressedSnapshotId`, and `occurrenceAddress` are present and match the addressed occurrence namespace being consumed.
2. Path-based joins may remain as an explicit temporary compatibility fallback during migration.
3. Fallback behavior must be documented, test-covered, and removable later by an explicit implementation slice.
4. Fallback diagnostics should make it clear when Tree used path compatibility instead of address identity.
5. Tree must not silently re-derive Naming semantic-family interpretation when Naming evidence is missing. Missing Naming evidence should remain missing, bounded, or diagnostic according to Tree-owned consumer policy.
6. Future v2 enrichment does not by itself authorize provider swaps, Tree consumption changes, fallback removal, helper extraction, CLI changes, report-envelope changes, or runtime bridge production.
7. Future v2 or sidecar migration must preserve the existing Naming-owned semantic observation payload, existing path/source-trace compatibility fields, and optional existing v1 `occurrenceType` behavior when available. It must not create an identity-and-enrichment-only payload that drops semantic evidence Tree currently consumes.
8. Tree must continue receiving Naming semantic evidence plus any approved enrichment; it must not be forced to reconstruct semantic-family interpretation from raw names, paths, neutral occurrence context, or diagnostic metadata.

Path fallback is current implementation reality and must not be removed in this contract slice.

## 9. Relationship to current audited runtime fields

| Current audited field/surface | Relationship to this contract |
| --- | --- |
| Tree-local `addressPath` | Current runtime truth. Preserve as compatibility/debug alias during migration. Do not rename in runtime code as part of this contract. |
| Tree-local `parentAddressPath` | Current runtime truth on addressed occurrence records. Future enriched bridge payloads may emit `parentOccurrenceAddress` sourced from this parent identity, but the old source field name is not approved as the bridge field name. |
| Structural-addressing `address` | Candidate source for neutral `occurrenceAddress`; exact aliasing remains an implementation-slice decision. |
| Structural-addressing `addressPath` | Candidate compatibility/debug alias and possible initial source for `occurrenceAddress`; must be interpreted inside profile/snapshot namespace. |
| Structural-addressing `profileId` | Candidate source for contract field `addressProfileId`; this spec uses the bridge field name `addressProfileId` for clarity. |
| Structural-addressing `snapshotOutputId` | Related to `addressedSnapshotId`, but not identical by contract until a later slice decides whether output id is sufficient or an instance/source id is required. |
| Current Naming bridge `occurrenceType` / structural-addressing `occurrenceType` | Existing optional v1 neutral occurrence-context / compatibility evidence when the addressed occurrence record supplies it. It remains Addressing-owned occurrence-type data that Naming may echo; it is not part of the canonical durable observation identity tuple, is not Tree folder-kind policy, remains valid in v1, and does not require a bridge version bump. |
| Structural-addressing `depth` | Approved future bridge enrichment source for `occurrenceDepth`; it remains neutral context evidence. |
| Structural-addressing `orderIndex` | Approved future bridge enrichment source for `occurrenceOrderIndex`; it remains deterministic ordering/diagnostic evidence, not identity. |
| Current Naming bridge `path` observations | Current runtime truth and temporary compatibility alias. Future bridge observations should preserve `repoRelativePath` / `path` compatibility during migration. |
| Current Tree semantic-home evidence join by `path` | Current runtime truth and temporary fallback path. Future Tree consumption should prefer address-keyed joins only when contract fields are present and Tree-owned qualification accepts them. |

## 10. Unresolved naming and migration follow-up notes

The following questions remain explicit follow-up work and are not resolved by runtime changes in this slice:

1. Whether `addressedSnapshotId` should be a run/snapshot instance id, a content digest, a source snapshot id, or a constrained alias of current `snapshotOutputId`.
2. Whether the future v2 bridge should emit approved enrichment fields directly on each observation, inside a nested `occurrenceContext` / `diagnostics` object, or in a separately named additive sidecar.
3. Whether structural-addressing `address` or `addressPath` should populate the first `occurrenceAddress` field in every producer path, and which compatibility alias must be retained in reports.
4. Which focused repeated-same-family fixtures should prove that address-keyed joins beat path/family bucket assumptions before fallback removal.
5. Which producer is the authoritative addressed snapshot provider for the cross-slice bridge: Tree-local addressed occurrences, structural-addressing addressed snapshots, or a later compatibility bridge between them.
6. Whether deferred partition keys should ever be emitted, and if so whether Addressing or Naming owns the exact grouping algorithm.
7. Whether deferred Naming token and role evidence should be modeled as bridge fields, a Naming-owned sidecar, or remain outside the occurrence bridge.

## 11. Non-goals

This spec does not:

- change runtime behavior;
- change current v1 Naming bridge payload production;
- change Tree join behavior;
- add enriched fields to runtime outputs;
- rename `addressPath` in runtime code;
- wire Tree runtime to a different structural-addressing provider;
- remove path fallback;
- remove known-roots or revive known-roots;
- promote Addressing to a standalone runnable validator slice;
- move Addressing semantics into suite-core;
- move tuple matching or join preparation into Addressing;
- require shared join-helper extraction;
- broaden Tree semantic-home, structural-home, scatter, cluster, or drift reasoning;
- add Tree confidence, severity, findings, or report-envelope policy to Naming bridge payloads;
- rework validator report envelopes;
- change CLI behavior;
- fix unrelated validator findings;
- perform broad docs cleanup outside this contract slice.

## 12. Recommended next implementation child

Recommended next implementation child: define and test a data-only, explicitly versioned `naming-occurrence-bridge.v2` payload or additive sidecar that preserves v1 identity, the complete current Naming-owned semantic observation payload, optional v1 `occurrenceType`, and path/source-trace compatibility while carrying only the genuinely new approved first enriched bridge set: `parentOccurrenceAddress`, `occurrenceDepth`, `occurrenceOrderIndex`, `disambiguationNotes`, and `evidenceLimitNotes`.

The preserved semantic payload must include at minimum `semanticName`, `familyRoot`, `semanticFamily`, `familySubgroup` when present, `ambiguityFlags` when present, `splitFamilyFlags` when present, and existing Naming disambiguation evidence when present. A sidecar child must define direct linkage or deterministic association to the complete current semantic observation payload and must leave that payload intact.

That child should still avoid Tree reasoning expansion. It should include focused tests for payload shape, semantic-payload preservation, version handling, unsupported-enrichment diagnostics, and explicit fallback behavior without removing the current path-based consumer path.
