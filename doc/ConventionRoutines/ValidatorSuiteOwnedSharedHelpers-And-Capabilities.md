# Validator Suite-Owned Shared Helpers and Capabilities Inventory

Classification: Normative

## 1) Purpose

This document is the canonical implementation-facing inventory for **currently existing** suite-owned shared helpers and reusable capabilities.

It is a reuse/navigation guide for implementation work so contributors can deterministically answer:

- whether a suite-owned shared helper/capability already exists,
- where it lives, and
- when to reuse it instead of reimplementing ad hoc.

This document complements, but does not replace:

- `ValidatorHelperAreas-And-Reuse-Conventions.md`
- `ValidatorLoaderConverterRuntimeOwnership-Contract.md`

## 2) Authority and boundary note

- This inventory is for reuse/navigation guidance.
- Canonical ownership and boundary rules remain governed by the existing ownership docs listed above.
- Do **not** interpret this inventory as permission to move slice-owned behavior into suite-core.
- Similar-looking behavior is not automatically shared behavior; ownership remains concern-first.

## 3) Current suite-owned shared helper/capability inventory

Only currently real, discoverable suite-owned surfaces are listed here.

### 3.1 Entry: suite-core CLI helper area

- **Owner:** suite-core
- **Path/area:** `src/core/cli/`
- **Concern:** shared validator CLI scaffolding for usage/error output flow and repeatable CLI argument parsing.
- **Reusable capability:**
  - structured report emission helpers via `validator-cli-output.logic.mjs`
  - usage/usage-error formatting and output via `validator-cli-usage.logic.mjs`
  - repeatable `--target` parsing/normalization via `validator-cli-targets.logic.mjs`
  - scope token/order and scope usage-line helpers via `validator-cli-scopes.logic.mjs`
- **When to reuse:**
  - adding/updating validator CLI entrypoints (`validate:naming`, `validate:tree`, `validate:all`, or new suite CLIs)
  - implementing repeatable `--target` argument handling
  - implementing consistent scope usage output derived from suite scope vocabulary
  - implementing report-first stdout emission + usage/error stderr behavior
- **When not to reuse:**
  - slice-internal runtime logic that is not CLI-facing
  - slice-specific parser semantics that belong to slice-owned CLI areas
- **Reuse boundary type:** helper-area reuse

### 3.2 Entry: shared scoped snapshot/input helper boundary

- **Owner:** suite-core
- **Path/area:** `src/core/suite-scoped-snapshot-input.logic.mjs`
- **Concern:** suite-owned scope profile selection and deterministic in-scope path/input collection.
- **Reusable capability:**
  - scope-profile read
  - `includeRoots` walking
  - `includeRootFiles` inclusion
  - normalized path collection
  - optional target filtering
  - deterministic sort/dedupe for selected path sets
- **When to reuse:**
  - any slice validator that needs suite-owned scope selection before slice interpretation
  - any cross-slice validator/composition that needs the same suite scope boundary
  - any implementation that must preserve suite-consistent scope + target semantics
- **When not to reuse:**
  - logic deciding what selected paths *mean* for a specific slice
  - slice heuristics that should remain slice-owned interpretation behavior
- **Reuse boundary type:** runtime boundary reuse (and composition boundary reuse for cross-slice composition)

### 3.3 Entry: suite-core validator candidate policy and collection helper

- **Owner:** suite-core
- **Path/area:**
  - `src/core/validator-candidate-policy.contracts.mjs`
  - `src/core/validator-candidate-policy.logic.mjs`
  - `src/core/validator-candidate-collection.logic.mjs`
- **Concern:** broad validator candidate policy contract and deterministic candidate collection mechanics before slice-owned interpretation.
- **Reusable capability:**
  - normalized candidate extension and candidate root-file policy inputs
  - walk-exclusion and skip-dot-directory inputs
  - suite scope/profile and target filtering reuse through existing suite-core scoped snapshot helpers
  - deterministic candidate path sorting and dedupe
- **When to reuse:**
  - proving or adopting shared broad candidate collection before a validator slice interprets candidate paths
  - adapting slice-owned candidate values into a suite-owned candidate collection contract without moving registry authority
- **When not to reuse:**
  - deciding what a filename, folder, semantic family, structural home, or candidate path means for a specific slice
  - moving slice-owned initial policy value authority into suite-core
- **Reuse boundary type:** contract/helper boundary reuse

### 3.4 Entry: suite-core exit policy derivation helper

- **Owner:** suite-core
- **Path/area:** `src/core/validator-exit-code.logic.mjs`
- **Concern:** deterministic suite exit-code derivation from findings and strict-mode semantics.
- **Reusable capability:**
  - derive exit code from findings (`deriveExitCodeFromFindings`)
  - derive exit code from composed runner reports (`deriveExitCodeFromRunnerReport`)
  - application of suite builtin exit policy predicates without duplicating policy checks in each CLI
- **When to reuse:**
  - any validator CLI that must map findings/report outputs to suite-consistent exit codes
  - composed suite execution paths where multiple validator findings feed one exit status
- **When not to reuse:**
  - non-validator tooling with intentionally different exit semantics
  - experimental policy behavior not yet part of suite exit policy contract
- **Reuse boundary type:** runtime boundary reuse

### 3.5 Entry: suite-core report meta + source snapshot helpers

- **Owner:** suite-core
- **Path/area:**
  - `src/core/validator-report-meta.logic.mjs`
  - `src/core/source-snapshot.logic.mjs`
  - `src/core/validator-direct-report.logic.mjs`
  - `src/core/validator-report-identity.logic.mjs`
- **Concern:** deterministic shared metadata helpers used in validator report envelopes.
- **Reusable capability:**
  - tool version lookup and stable hashing/digest helpers for config/report metadata
  - git/filesystem source snapshot metadata capture for report reproducibility context
  - direct validator report envelope mechanics for mode, validator identity, version, config digest, source snapshot, timestamps, and duration
  - bounded report identity lookup from registry report metadata when parity tests prove current emitted identity fields stay unchanged
- **When to reuse:**
  - constructing validator or runner report envelopes that require suite-consistent metadata fields
  - constructing direct validator reports that must preserve slice-owned findings and summaries while sharing suite-core envelope mechanics
  - computing deterministic config digest/fingerprint values used across validators
- **When not to reuse:**
  - slice-specific finding logic or traversal mechanics
  - policy registry canonicalization that belongs in loader/converter layers
- **Reuse boundary type:** composition boundary reuse

### 3.6 Entry: suite-core validator registry metadata surface

- **Owner:** suite-core
- **Path/area:**
  - `src/core/validator-registry.knowledge.mjs`
  - `src/core/validator-report-capture-metadata.logic.mjs`
- **Concern:** data-only slice registration metadata for current validator-suite registration surfaces.
- **Current runtime truth:** registry entries keep `id`, `description`, and `run` as the runner behavior-driving fields. Registry report metadata may drive behavior-preserving runner/direct report identity fields where parity tests prove the emitted report stays stable. Registry command metadata may drive bounded direct usage text where parity tests prove the command surface stays stable. Report-capture preset metadata records current package-script capture mechanics and may be read by tests or inspection helpers, but package scripts remain literal current runtime truth until a separately scoped behavior migration changes that. Other metadata remains inspectable registration data and does not drive runner dispatch, package scripts, package bins, exit-code behavior, Naming behavior, Tree behavior, or candidate behavior.
- **Reusable capability:**
  - canonical slice identity metadata aligned to the registry id;
  - report identity metadata aligned to current report entry id/validator id/description;
  - repo-local npm command, direct script, package-bin availability, and report-capture prefix expectations;
  - report-capture package-script presets for current Naming, Tree, validate-all, and explicitly deferred Addressing capture surfaces;
  - default `validate:all` runner inclusion and direct-runnable/runner-only capability metadata;
  - bounded bridge metadata for the current Naming semantic-family bridge contribution consumed by Tree;
  - compatibility expectation metadata for current report-mode and behavior-preserving registration.
- **When to reuse:**
  - inspecting current suite-core slice registration surfaces;
  - adding a future validator slice that needs the same bounded registration facts;
  - writing shape tests that prove command/report/bin expectations are explicit without changing scripts or bins;
  - writing report-capture preset tests that compare registry-backed metadata to literal package scripts and representative emitted reports;
  - sourcing runner/direct report identity fields when exact parity coverage proves the current report shape is preserved;
  - sourcing direct command usage text when exact parity coverage proves the command surface is preserved.
- **When not to reuse:**
  - driving runtime runner selection, broader report shape, exit policy, or package command generation before a separate behavior-migration task explicitly scopes that change;
  - treating command metadata as authority for Naming or Tree semantic interpretation;
  - treating report-capture metadata as semantic policy or as authority for finding ids, summaries, severities, Naming interpretation, Tree reasoning, Addressing behavior, or report output shape;
  - storing slice-owned semantic interpretation policy, finding policy, Naming taxonomy, Tree placement policy, or candidate value authority in suite-core metadata;
  - creating a universal plugin architecture or generic shared bucket.
- **Reuse boundary type:** data-only registration metadata boundary

## 4) Guardrails

- Do **not** invent shared helpers in this inventory that do not currently exist.
- Do **not** treat runner/composition/runtime modules generically as "helpers" unless the reusable capability is explicit and bounded.
- Do **not** bypass slice ownership just because behavior looks similar.
- Prefer reuse of actual suite-owned capabilities above over ad hoc reimplementation when concern + owner match.

## 5) Codex-oriented usage note

Before adding new cross-slice helper logic:

1. Check this inventory first.
2. If an existing suite-owned helper/capability matches both concern and owner, reuse it.
3. If no entry matches, fall back to:
   - `ValidatorHelperAreas-And-Reuse-Conventions.md` for helper-area routing, and
   - `ValidatorLoaderConverterRuntimeOwnership-Contract.md` for loader/converter/runtime boundary ownership.

This keeps implementation ROI aligned with clear boundaries, deterministic organization, and extraction-friendly growth.
