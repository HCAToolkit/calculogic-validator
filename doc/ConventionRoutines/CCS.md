# Calculogic Concern System (CCS, NL-Aligned, Codebase-Level)

## 1. First Principles

### Configuration is semantic, not a file

A Configuration is a semantic module (e.g. “Global Header Shell”, “Tab Navigation”).

It spans up to six concerns: Build, BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, ResultsStyle.

Code lives in six concern files; the configuration is defined by its NL skeleton, not its file layout. The canonical section layout and numbering for NL skeletons is defined in `General-NL-Skeletons.md` and every configuration or shell document must follow it exactly.

### NL Skeleton as the Ordering Source

- Each configuration has an NL Configuration Skeleton (or ProjectShell skeleton).
- The skeleton’s numbered sections (3 = Build, 4 = BuildStyle, 5 = Logic, 6 = Knowledge, 7 = Results, 8 = ResultsStyle) define the canonical top-down order for all concerns.
- Code in all concern files must follow this order and mirror the same numbering in comments.

### Concerns vs. Hierarchical Types (Orthogonal Axes)

Every Atomic Component has:

- A Concern: Build / BuildStyle / Logic / Knowledge / Results / ResultsStyle.
- A Hierarchical type: Container, Subcontainer, or Primitive.

These axes are independent: you can have a Logic Container, a Build Primitive, a ResultsStyle Primitive, etc.

### Purity per Concern

- Build – structure only (containers, subcontainers, primitives; no state, no visual design tokens).
- BuildStyle – styling of structure only (layout, spacing, responsive rules; no DOM creation, no state).
- Logic – interaction, workflows, state, derived flags; no DOM, no CSS.
- Knowledge – copy, constants, reference tables; no state mutation, no layout, no behavior.
- Results – derived outputs / readouts; no structure creation beyond what Build defines.
- ResultsStyle – styling of results; no structure, no logic.

### Folder Mapping

- Build → files like `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.build.tsx` or `src/shells/<shellId>/<ShellName>.build.tsx`
- BuildStyle → CSS or CSS-Module files like `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.build.module.css` or `src/shells/<shellId>/<ShellName>.build.css`
- Logic → files like `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.logic.ts` (or `.logic.tsx` when React hooks are required)
- Knowledge → files like `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.knowledge.ts`
- Results → files like `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.results.ts` (or `.results.tsx` when JSX is emitted)
- ResultsStyle → CSS or CSS-Module files like `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.results.module.css` or `src/shells/<shellId>/<ShellName>.results.css`

Shells follow the same pattern within `src/shells/<shellId>/`, sharing the same base name across all concern files. BuildStyle and ResultsStyle are implemented as CSS/CSS-Module files; the corresponding Build and Results `.tsx` components expose the class names and data attributes that those styles consume.

### Structure Source and Fallbacks

- Build is the default structural source for any UI configuration or shell.
- Non-structural concerns (BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, ResultsStyle) never create or reorder structure; they attach to anchors defined by Build.
- Fallback (rare): if a configuration has no Build (e.g. a pure data concern), use the highest present non-style concern as the mental ordering source (Logic → Knowledge → Results), but it still must not invent DOM structure.

### Anchors Are Stable

- Every visible piece of structure exposes stable anchors (class, data-anchor, or id).
- All non-Build concerns refer to these anchors, never to incidental DOM or query patterns.

### Directional Dependencies

- Build → BuildStyle / Logic / ResultsStyle.
- Logic → Results.
- Knowledge informs all but depends on none.
- No upward or cyclic imports (e.g., Results cannot feed Logic, Logic cannot define anchors).

### Locality

- Code for one configuration’s concerns lives in its folder under `builder/configs/` or `builder/shells/`.
- Nested configurations (e.g., a shell zone as its own config) live inside the parent’s folder but obey all the same rules independently.

### Monotonic Diffs

When you change structure in the NL skeleton for a configuration, corresponding changes in Build, BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, and ResultsStyle must appear in the same top-down order when you read each file.

## 2. Configuration Definition Template (Per Configuration or Shell)

Use this before writing code or asking AI to generate code.

### NL Skeleton

Create `doc/nl-config/cfg-*.md` or `doc/nl-shell/shell-*.md` using the General NL Skeleton – Configuration-Level or ProjectShell-Level.

That document is the canonical contract for:

- Purpose and scope.
- Per-concern responsibilities.
- Containers/Subcontainers/Primitives and their order.
- Numbering (3.x.y, 4.x.y, 5.x.y, etc.).

### Concern Entry (Per Configuration)

- Name: Short, unambiguous; use `cfg-*` for configs, `shell-*` for shells.
- Purpose (1 sentence): What outcome this configuration achieves.
- In-Scope / Out-of-Scope: Boundaries for behavior and structure.
- Concerns present: Build / BuildStyle / Logic / Knowledge / Results / ResultsStyle (which apply).
- Anchors: The structural anchors owned by this configuration (Build).
- Inputs: Props/context/events it consumes.
- Outputs: Events, derived values, results, or debug UI it emits.
- Invariants: Truths that must always hold (e.g. “Tabs never wrap; scroll instead”).
- Dependencies: Only on lower-level utilities, shared hooks, or Knowledge; no cross-concern cheating.

## 3. Atomic Components (Per Concern)

For each concern in the NL skeleton, list:

- Containers – top-level roots for that concern in this configuration.
- Subcontainers – nested encapsulations inside Containers.
- Primitives – leaves: individual fields, rules, styles, state atoms, maps, result lines.

### Rules

- A concern can have one or more Containers at the top level.
- Subcontainers only appear inside Containers (never at the root of a concern).
- Primitives never contain anything else.
- Containers may be:
  - Flat roots (contain only primitives), or
  - Hierarchical roots (contain subcontainers and primitives).

## 4. Decision Rules (What Belongs Where, NL-Aware)

Use these to keep responsibilities clean.

### Structure vs Interaction vs Readout

- Changes to regions, zones, section layout → Build.
- Visual variants, responsiveness, spacing → BuildStyle / ResultsStyle.
- State, validation, transitions, routing → Logic.
- Copy, labels, options, thresholds → Knowledge.
- Counters, scores, derived summaries → Results.

### No Structure in Non-Structural Concerns

BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, ResultsStyle must not introduce new DOM or change sibling ordering. They attach to anchors established in Build.

### Results Is “Where Data Ends”

Once you are just showing derived information (e.g., state summaries, counts, debug), it belongs in Results / ResultsStyle; it cannot mutate structure or state.

### Knowledge Is Guidance, Not Behavior

Tooltips, doc text, label maps, thresholds live in Knowledge and do not contain side effects or layout code.

### Use the NL Hierarchy to Split or Merge

If you can’t describe a section of behavior/structure in a single NL bullet under one concern, it’s a sign you have multiple concerns tangled together—split them.

## 5. Nested vs Sibling Configurations

### Nested Configuration (All Must Be True)

- It attaches to specific anchors owned by a parent configuration.
- It cannot operate meaningfully without that parent structure.
- It never reorders or replaces the parent’s anchors.

Example: The global header shell includes a nested tab-strip configuration that mounts directly into the header’s Build anchors.

### Sibling Configuration (Otherwise)

- It uses the same frame (shell) but defines its own Build structure and anchors.
- Promote from nested → sibling when a feature gains its own structure, reuse, or lifecycle.

Example: `cfg-intro`, `cfg-q-motivations`, and `cfg-buildSurface` coexist as siblings that the spa host shell swaps within the same main-pane frame.

## 6. Change Management

### When You Change a Configuration

Update its NL skeleton first:

- Adjust the numbering and text for any moved/added/removed Container/Subcontainer/Primitive.

Then update code:

- Adjust Build to match the new NL order.
- Update BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, ResultsStyle in the same pass, keeping the same ordering and comment numbers.

Preserve anchors if possible:

- If anchors must change, treat that as a deliberate breaking change and update all attached concerns.

### Acceptance (Per PR)

- NL skeleton updated and committed.
- Build matches NL structure and order.
- All other concerns follow the same ordering via comments.
- Concerns respect purity and directional dependencies.
- Comments (file headers + section headers + atomic comments) present and consistent.
