# Calculogic Comment & Provenance Protocol (CCPP, NL-Aligned)

> Draft alignment note: CCPP remains NL-first and production-usable now. It is additionally aligned with `doc/ConventionRoutines/DeterministicStructuralAddressingSpec-Draft.md` for optional structural-address references, without finalizing that draft’s deferred decisions.

## 1. Purpose

Comments encode intent, structure, and provenance in a way that:

- Mirrors the NL skeleton order.
- Helps AI reconstruct or extend code from NL.
- Keeps files navigable top-down.

Comments are not narration of obvious code; they are a projection of the NL skeleton and decisions into the codebase.

CCPP currently requires NL section IDs/section numbers (for example `[3.2.2]`) as the primary comment anchor. Structural addresses are a separate draft concept and may be included as supplementary metadata where helpful.

> Terminology scoping reference: when prose could confuse source-of-truth vs destination planning vs syntax/order meanings of "canonical", prefer scoped terms from `doc/ConventionRoutines/TerminologyScoping-Conventions-V1.md` (for example `canonical_source`, `canonical_target`, `canonical_order`, `canonical_grammar`).

## 2. Comment Types (Use Only These)

- File Header – one per file.
- Section Header – top of each config section inside a file.
- Atomic Comment – immediately before a Container/Subcontainer/Primitive.
- Inline Rationale – rare; why a non-obvious line/block exists.
- Decision Note – tiny ADR embedded in code.
- TODO with expiry – actionable, owner + date.
- Provenance Block – when external logic/content influences code (no payload).

## 3. Required Fields & Format

### 3.1 File Header (TS/TSX/JS, etc.)

```ts
/**
 * ProjectShell/Config: Global Header Shell (shell-globalHeader)
 * Concern File: Build | BuildStyle | Logic | Knowledge | Results | ResultsStyle
 * Source NL: doc/nl-shell/shell-globalHeader.md
 * Responsibility: <one sentence for this concern file>
 * Invariants: <comma-separated truths>
 * Notes: <optional; ADR id, link, or short note>
 */
```

For non-shell configs, replace `ProjectShell/Config` with `Configuration: cfg-....`.

### 3.2 Section Header (Per Configuration Inside a Concern File)

```ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// 3. Build – cfg-tabNavigation (Tab Navigation)
// NL Sections: §3.0–3.3 in cfg-tabNavigation.md
// Purpose: <short purpose>
// Constraints: <key constraints or perf/a11y notes>
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The leading number (`3.` here) matches the NL skeleton’s concern index.

### 3.3 Atomic Comment (Container / Subcontainer / Primitive)

```ts
// [3.2.2] cfg-tabNavigation · Subcontainer · "Center Zone – Tab Strip"
// Concern: Build · Parent: "Global Header Shell" · Catalog: layout.group
// Structural Address (Draft, optional): A.2.3.1
// Notes: hosts 4 tabs and info icons; no reordering; center-aligned
function GlobalHeaderTabStripZone() {
  ...
}
```

Rules:

- First line: `[NLSectionNumber] cfg-id · HierarchicalType · "Name"`.
- Second line: Concern, Parent (if any), Catalog id.
- Optional line: `Structural Address (Draft, optional): <address>` when needed for draft-aligned structural tracing.
- Final line: `Notes: ...` short intent/constraint note (keep Notes separate from the metadata line for deterministic readability).

Atomic-comment requirement remains NL-section-based. Do not replace the bracket token with structural-address grammar in this pass.

Draft boundary protection for atomic comments:

- Do not mandate host-prefixed tokens inside bracket IDs unless/until that decision is closed in the structural-address draft.
- Do not introduce placeholder markers such as `x` in production comment IDs.
- Do not enforce new leading-zero transformations in CCPP examples until the draft decision is finalized.
- If a structural address is included, treat it as draft-aligned supplemental metadata and keep NL section IDs authoritative for CCPP synchronization.

These should read like compressed NL bullets and are the main thing AI should preserve.

### 3.4 Inline Rationale

```ts
// WHY: Avoids focus loss when switching tabs via keyboard
```

Use sparingly, only when the reason is not obvious.

### 3.5 Decision Note

```ts
// DECISION: Tab hover previews via CSS only | 2025-11-05
// Context: Keep Logic lightweight for header interactions
// Choice: Use CSS hover for previews instead of JS listeners
// Consequence: Less JS complexity; no previews on touch devices
// ADR: header-hover-001   // optional
```

Promote a Decision note to a standalone ADR when the rationale spans multiple paragraphs, introduces cross-team dependencies, or affects more than one configuration. Longer decisions live alongside other records in `doc/decisions/*.md`; reference the ADR id from the inline note once it exists.

### 3.6 TODO with Expiry

```ts
// TODO(@owner, 2025-12-01): Wire openDoc(docId) to docs modal shell
```

Must always have owner and date.

### 3.7 Provenance Block

```ts
// SOURCE: https://example.org/a11y/tabs
// Accessed: 2025-11-05T14:22:00Z
// Note: Pattern used as reference for keyboard tab navigation; no content copied
```

No payload; just reference.

## 4. Language & Mapping

- `TS/TSX/JS`: `/** ... */` for file header; `// ...` for everything else.
- `CSS`: `/* ... */` for file and atomic comments; still match NL numbers.
- `JSON`: no comments; if needed, keep a `.meta` or `.md` doc instead.
- `Markdown docs`: NL skeletons themselves.

Remember the concern-to-file mapping: Build/Results use `.tsx` structure files, BuildStyle/ResultsStyle are CSS or CSS-Module files that consume the anchors emitted by those structures, Logic lives in `.ts`/`.tsx` modules, and Knowledge is `.ts` data. Comment styles must match the host language.

## 5. NL Skeleton Alignment

Every concern file must have:

- A file header linking to its NL doc.
- Section headers for each configuration in NL order.
- Atomic comments for each Container/Subcontainer/Primitive referenced in NL.

The NL skeleton is the source:

- When a number changes in NL (e.g. `3.2.1 → 3.2.2`), comments should be updated to match.
- When a new atomic is added to NL, a new atomic comment + code block is added in the same position.

Structural addresses (draft) do not replace NL section IDs in this protocol. If used, they supplement existing atomic comments and should remain consistent with the current draft grammar.

## 6. Strict Do / Don’t

### Do

- Use NL section numbers `[3.2.1]` consistently across files.
- Keep NL section numbers as the required CCPP anchor even when draft structural addresses are present.
- Explain why something exists, not what it does.
- Keep comments short and structured (good for humans and AI).
- Update NL + comments in the same change as code.

### Don’t

- Narrate obvious code.
- Add code that doesn’t correspond to a skeleton section (unless you add it to NL first).
- Use unlabeled `TODO:`.
- Copy external content into comments.
- Treat deferred structural-address decisions as finalized CCPP requirements.

## 7. Minimal Examples

### Build file

```ts
/**
 * Configuration: cfg-tabNavigation (Tab Navigation)
 * Concern File: Build
 * Source NL: doc/nl-config/cfg-tabNavigation.md
 * Responsibility: Header tab strip structure (no styling, no behavior)
 * Invariants: Tabs never wrap; center zone stays in single row
 */

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// 3. Build – cfg-tabNavigation (Tab Navigation)
// NL Sections: §3.0–3.3 in cfg-tabNavigation.md
// Purpose: Provide 4 canonical tabs in fixed order
// Constraints: Order fixed: Build, Logic, Knowledge, Results
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────

// [3.1] cfg-tabNavigation · Container · "Global Header Shell"
// Concern: Build · Catalog: layout.shell
// Structural Address (Draft, optional): A.1.3
export function GlobalHeaderShell() { ... }
```

### BuildStyle file

```css
/*
 * Configuration: cfg-tabNavigation (Tab Navigation)
 * Concern File: BuildStyle
 * Source NL: doc/nl-config/cfg-tabNavigation.md
 * Responsibility: Visual styling of header tab strip (no structure)
 * Invariants: Tabs remain single-line; scroll instead of wrap
*/

/* [4.2.1] cfg-tabNavigation · Primitive · "Tab Item Base Rule"
   Matches Build primitive [3.3.4–3.3.7] (tab buttons)
*/
.globalHeader__tab {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Bad vs. Good Atomic Comments

- Bad:
  - `// handles tab click`
  - `const handleClick = () => setActive(tabId);`
  - (Narrates the obvious and lacks NL reference.)
- Good:
  - `// [5.2.2] cfg-tabNavigation · Primitive · "handleTabSelect"`
  - `// Concern: Logic · Parent: "Tab Navigation Logic" · Catalog: logic.handler`
  - `// Structural Address (Draft, optional): A.1.5.2`
  - `// Notes: syncs active tab state`
  - `const handleTabSelect = (tabId: string) => setActiveTab(tabId);`

## 8. Maintenance Rules

On every structural change:

- Update the NL skeleton first.
- Then update code and comments to match:
  - Keep section headers in NL order.
  - Keep atomic comments synchronized with NL numbers.
- Remove or update any Decision notes that no longer apply (add new ones instead of rewriting history).
- Clean up or close TODOs on each release cut.

## 9. Pre-Merge CCPP Review Checklist

Before merging, confirm each touched concern file passes all checks:

- [ ] File header uses `Configuration:` or `ProjectShell/Config:` (as applicable), includes `Concern File`, `Source NL`, `Responsibility`, and `Invariants`.
- [ ] Section headers exist for each implemented concern and follow NL concern order/numbering.
- [ ] Every Container/Subcontainer/Primitive in code has an atomic comment immediately above it with NL section id.
- [ ] Atomic comment lines include Concern, Parent (if applicable), and Catalog id.
- [ ] NL numbering in comments matches the current NL skeleton document.
- [ ] If a structural address is present in comments, it is labeled draft/optional and is supplementary (NL section ID remains authoritative).
- [ ] Any structural-address usage in comments is consistent with the current draft spec (`doc/ConventionRoutines/DeterministicStructuralAddressingSpec-Draft.md`) and does not assume deferred decisions are final.
- [ ] Any TODOs include owner + expiry date; any external references use provenance-only blocks.

## 10. Draft Structural Addressing Cross-Reference

- Structural-address grammar and examples live in `doc/ConventionRoutines/DeterministicStructuralAddressingSpec-Draft.md`.
- CCPP remains focused on comment/provenance protocol and NL synchronization behavior.
- Until deferred decisions are closed in the draft spec, CCPP should treat structural addresses as optional draft-aligned metadata, not as a replacement for NL section IDs.
