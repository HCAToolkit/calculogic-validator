# General NL Skeletons

This doc defines the canonical NL skeleton templates used by all configuration (`doc/nl-config/*.md`) and shell (`doc/nl-shell/*.md`) documents. Section numbers (1–10) and concern ordering are considered stable contracts.

## Addressing & Numbering Note (Draft Alignment)

- **NL section numbering (this doc):** The `1–10` section structure below is a stable documentation/template contract.
- **Structural Address (Draft):** Deterministic structural positioning (host-present or no-host forms) is a supplementary addressing layer described in `DeterministicStructuralAddressingSpec-Draft.md`.
- **Relationship between the two:** These systems are related but **not identical**. Structural addresses do not replace NL section numbering in this skeleton.
- **Template usage:** Where useful, templates may record structural addresses as **draft, optional metadata** alongside NL content.
- **Placeholder note (`x`):** This document follows the authoritative placeholder legality rule in `DeterministicStructuralAddressingSpec-Draft.md` (§10.2). Any `x` usage here is non-canonical and allowed only for illustrative/template contexts.
- **Marking requirement:** Any example/template in this document that uses `x` MUST be explicitly marked `Illustrative` or `Placeholder`.
- **Governance note:** Comment/provenance protocol conventions remain governed by `CCPP.md`; this doc remains the canonical NL skeleton structure source.
- **Classification note:** Apply content labels per `DocumentContentClassificationConvention-V1.md` when ambiguity exists (for example: `Normative` rules vs `Illustrative` or `Placeholder` examples).

## Split-Canonical NL Migration Clarification (Policy)

- Semantic refactors may introduce **split-canonical NL docs** for a configuration when one monolithic NL file becomes too broad for maintainable co-migration.
- During transition, the legacy monolith may temporarily operate as a **wrapper/index/forwarding** document that points to split-canonical targets.
- The stable **1–10 section contract remains unchanged per NL document**. Split docs still follow the same top-level contract; this policy does not redesign or renumber the skeleton template.

### Numbering & Provenance Continuity for Split Migration

- Preserve continuity in content via explicit provenance/mapping references (for example, legacy section ranges and migrated atom IDs).
- Keep numbering continuity in headings, mapping tables, provenance tokens, and migration manifests/indexes rather than requiring filename position prefixes.
- A lightweight manifest/index may be used to improve visual ordering and scanability across split docs; this is recommended guidance, not a hard requirement.

## Changing This Doc

If you change top-level sections or numbering here, you must also update `NL-First-Workflow.md`, `CCS.md`, and `CCPP.md` to keep the system consistent.

## 1) General NL Skeleton – Configuration-Level

Use this for things like “Motivations question,” individual sections, etc.

Configuration: [Config Name] ([config-id])
Project: [Project Name] ([project-id])
Type: [Configuration type, e.g. Question Block / Section / Interaction]
Scope: [Local to page / shared / referenced by others]
Passes: [0–7] (Multi-pass implementation)

### Semantic Notes

- A Configuration is a semantic module, not a file.
- It spans up to six concerns: Build, BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, ResultsStyle.
- Per-configuration implementation files commonly live under paths like:
  - `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.build.tsx` (structure)
  - `src/configs/<configId>/<ConfigName>.build-style.module.css` (configuration styling)
  - Other concern files with matching base names.
- The engine or build step may merge those files into project-level bundles such as `src/projects/<projectId>/Project.build.tsx`.
- BuildStyle and ResultsStyle are implemented as CSS/CSS-Module files (for example `[ConfigName].build-style.module.css` and `[ConfigName].results-style.module.css`) that target the anchors emitted by the Build and Results `.tsx` concerns.
- Note: Actual repository naming should still follow the naming master and current repo conventions.
- All content of a configuration is expressed as Atomic Components.
- Each atomic component has:
  - a concern (Build / BuildStyle / Logic / Knowledge / Results / ResultsStyle), and
  - a hierarchical type: Container, Subcontainer, or Primitive.
- Most atoms belong to exactly one configuration. Some Knowledge/System atoms may be project-global (e.g. breakpoints, brand tokens) and are documented separately.
- Hierarchical types:
  - Container – top-level encapsulation in a concern for this configuration; not nested inside other Containers in that concern; may contain Subcontainers and/or Primitives directly (flat or hierarchical).
  - Subcontainer – nested encapsulation; always inside a Container or another Subcontainer; never at the root of a concern.
  - Primitive – leaf unit; contains nothing else (single field, rule, style block, kb map, result line, etc.).
- Concern vs hierarchy are orthogonal.
  - Any valid combination is allowed as long as the concern’s purity rules are respected.

### Draft Structural-Address Usage Notes (Supplementary)

- **No-host mode (common):** For standalone/local configurations without a host composition file, draft structural addresses may be recorded in no-host form.
- **Host-present mode (common in composed shells/layouts):** When a host composes zones/panels/substructures, draft structural addresses may be recorded in host-present form.
- This guidance is descriptive and draft-aligned; final structural-address policy and token decisions remain deferred to the draft spec.
- Concern ordering and NL-first structure are unchanged by this supplementary layer.

## 2) General NL Skeleton – ProjectShell-Level (Global Shells)

Use this for things like the Global Header, App Shell, persistent sidebars.

ProjectShell Configuration: [Shell Name] ([shell-id])
Project: [Project Name] ([project-id])
Type: Persistent [Shell type, e.g. Navigation Shell / App Layout Shell]
Scope: Global – wraps all Configuration views
Passes: [0–7] (Multi-pass implementation)

### Semantic Notes

- A ProjectShell is still a Configuration in the semantic sense, but it is global and persistent.
- It spans the same concerns as configuration-level templates.
  - Concerns: Build, BuildStyle, Logic, Knowledge, Results, ResultsStyle.
  - Expression model: Atomic Components (Containers, Subcontainers, Primitives).
- Many Knowledge atoms here will be project-global (tab definitions, routes, breakpoints, brand content) and consumed by other configurations.

### Draft Structural-Address Usage Notes (Supplementary)

- **No-host mode:** Can be used for shell-local structures when no external host composition file is involved.
- **Host-present mode (common for global shells):** When the shell participates in/acts as a host composition context for nested zones, draft host-present structural addresses may be recorded as optional metadata.
- Structural addresses here remain draft guidance and do not alter the stable `1–10` NL section contract.

### 1. Purpose and Scope

- 1.1 This shell provides the global [header/sidebar/layout] that persists across all Configuration views.
- 1.2 It manages [navigation state, modes, responsive layout, etc.].
- 1.3 It coordinates with routing and configuration context.

### 2. Configuration Contracts

#### 2.1 TypeScript Interfaces

- Shell-level state types (tabs, modes, viewport, etc.).

#### 2.2 Global State Requirements

- What global state this shell owns or consumes.

#### 2.3 Routing & Context

- URL patterns, config ID context, etc.

### 3. Build Concern (Structure)

#### 3.0 Dependencies & Hierarchy Notes

- Parent App, routing, providers.
- This shell has one or more Containers at the top level for Build.
  - Shell zones are modeled as Subcontainers and Primitives under those containers.

#### 3.1 Atomic Components — Containers (Build) – `[Shell Container]`

- Hierarchical type: Container
- Concern: Build
- Catalog base: `layout.group / layout.shell`
- Zones: left/center/right, top/bottom, etc.
- Anchor: shell-level anchor if needed.
- Structural Address (Draft, optional): `[A.1.2 / 3.1 / etc.]`

#### 3.2 Atomic Components — Subcontainers (Build) – `[Shell Zones]`

- Zone A Subcontainer: [Brand / Nav / Tools]
- Zone B Subcontainer: [Tabs / Modes / Breadcrumbs]
- Zone C Subcontainer: [Actions / Profile / Publish]
- Structural Address (Draft, optional, Classification: **Placeholder**): `[A.1.2.1 / 3.2.x / etc.]`

#### 3.3 Atomic Components — Primitives (Build)

- Buttons, labels, icons, previews, etc., assigned to each zone as leaf-level primitives.
- Structural Address (Draft, optional, Classification: **Placeholder**): `[A.1.2.1.4 / 3.3.x / etc.]`

### 4. BuildStyle Concern (Visual Styling of Structure)

#### 4.0 Dependencies

- Theme tokens and global layout rules.

#### 4.1 Base Layout Styles

#### 5.4 Shell-Specific Workflows

- e.g. Publish, open docs, open settings.

### 6. Knowledge Concern (Reference Data)

#### 6.1 Shell Metadata (often project-global Knowledge atoms)

- Tab definitions, routes, tooltips.

#### 6.2 Breakpoints

- Thresholds + helper functions (often project-global).

#### 6.3 Brand Content

- Wordmark, tagline, home tooltip.

### 7. Results Concern (Outputs)

#### 7.1 Navigation State Output

- Debug display / current route string.

#### 7.2 Accessibility Announcements

- Tab change messages, mode change messages.

### 8. ResultsStyle Concern (Output Styling)

#### 8.1 Debug Overlay Styles

#### 8.2 Any special shell-only result visuals

### 9. Assembly Pattern

#### 9.1 File Structure

- Implementation pattern reference.

```text
/src/shells/[shell-id]/[ShellName]/

#### 10.2 Export Checklist

- Shell renders correctly at all breakpoints.
- Global state + routing are in sync.
- All zones behave as specified.
- Debug + accessibility pieces wired up.
